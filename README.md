# Next.js Dashboard (TypeScript + Tailwind)

This is a small Next.js + TypeScript dashboard demo with a members table that includes:
- Filters (name, verification status, account status)
- Sorting by clicking column headers (cycles asc → desc → off)
- Pagination (simple page size and controls)

To run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Tailwind is already configured. This project uses static mock data located at `data/members.ts`.
